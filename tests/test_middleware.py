"""
This module contains test cases for the RedirectMiddleware in a Django application.

The RedirectMiddleware is tested using the pytest framework. The module defines several fixtures
to set up the necessary objects for testing, such as middleware, a client, and a request factory.

Test cases in this module include:

1. `test_valid_url(middleware, rf)`: This test ensures that a valid URL is not redirected when
   processed by the RedirectMiddleware. It uses the `middleware` and `rf` fixtures to create a
   request and verify that the response matches the expected result.

2. `test_middleware_in_integration(client)`: This test checks the middleware's behavior in an
   integration scenario. It uses the `client` fixture to send a request to an invalid URL and
   verifies that the response has a status code of 302 (indicating a redirect) and is redirected
   to the specified `REDIRECT_URL`.

Note: The `RedirectMiddleware` is expected to return the string "42" as a placeholder response in
the provided test cases. Actual behavior may vary depending on the real implementation of the
middleware.

    Test case to verify that a valid URL is not redirected when processed by the RedirectMiddleware.

    Parameters:
        - middleware: An instance of the RedirectMiddleware fixture.
        - request_factory: An instance of the RequestFactory fixture.

    Test Steps:
    1. Creates a request object for a valid URL using the RequestFactory.
    2. Passes the request through the middleware.
    3. Asserts that the response from the middleware is equal to "42," indicating that the
    middleware did not perform a redirect.

    Note:
        This test assumes that the middleware should return the string "42" for valid URLs. The
        actual behavior may depend on the real implementation of the middleware.
