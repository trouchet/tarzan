"""
This module contains test cases for the RedirectMiddleware in a Django application.

The RedirectMiddleware is tested using the pytest framework. The module defines several fixtures
to set up the necessary objects for testing, such as middleware, a client, and a request factory.

Test cases in this module include:

1. `test_valid_url(middleware, rf)`: This test ensures that a valid URL is not redirected when
   processed by the RedirectMiddleware. It uses the `middleware` and `rf` fixtures to create a
   request and verify that the response matches the expected result.

2. `test_middleware_in_integration(client)`: This test checks the middleware's behavior in an
   integration scenario. It uses the `client` fixture to send a request to an invalid URL and
   verifies that the response has a status code of 302 (indicating a redirect) and is redirected
   to the specified `REDIRECT_URL`.

Note: The `RedirectMiddleware` is expected to return the string "42" as a placeholder response in
the provided test cases. Actual behavior may vary depending on the real implementation of the
middleware.

@pytest.fixture
def middleware():
    """
    Fixture for creating an instance of the RedirectMiddleware. This middleware is typically used
    to redirect requests to a specific URL or perform some processing. In this fixture, a lambda
    function is used to create a simple instance of the middleware that returns the string "42" as
    a placeholder response.

    Usage:
        You can use this fixture in your test cases to obtain an instance of the RedirectMiddleware.

    Example:
        middleware_instance = middleware()
    """
    return RedirectMiddleware(lambda request: "42")


@pytest.fixture
def client():
    """
    Fixture for creating an instance of the Django Client. The Client is a test client provided by
    Django for simulating HTTP requests. It allows you to send requests to your Django application and
    retrieve the responses for testing purposes.

    Usage:
        You can use this fixture in your test cases to obtain an instance of the Django Client.

    Example:
        test_client = client()
    """
    return Client()


@pytest.fixture
def rf():
    """
    Fixture for creating an instance of the Django RequestFactory. The RequestFactory is a utility
    for creating request objects, which can be used to simulate HTTP requests in Django test cases.
    This fixture is commonly used to create request objects for testing middleware and views.

    Usage:
        You can use this fixture in your test cases to obtain an instance of the RequestFactory.

    Example:
        request_factory = rf()
    """
    return RequestFactory()


REDIRECT_URL = "/api/"
VALID_URL = REDIRECT_URL
INVALID_URL = "/invalid/"

def test_valid_url(middleware, rf):
    """
    Test case to verify that a valid URL is not redirected when processed by the RedirectMiddleware.

    Parameters:
        - middleware: An instance of the RedirectMiddleware fixture.
        - rf: An instance of the RequestFactory fixture.

    Test Steps:
    1. Creates a request object for a valid URL using the RequestFactory.
    2. Passes the request through the middleware.
    3. Asserts that the response from the middleware is equal to "42," indicating that the middleware
    did not perform a redirect.

    Note:
        This test assumes that the middleware should return the string "42" for valid URLs. The actual
        behavior may depend on the real implementation of the middleware.

    # Test a valid URL should not be redirected
    request = rf.get(VALID_URL)

def test_middleware_in_integration(client):
    """
    Test case to check the behavior of the RedirectMiddleware in an integration scenario.

    Parameters:
        - client: An instance of the Client fixture.

    Test Steps:
    1. Sends an HTTP GET request to an invalid URL using the Django Client.
    2. Verifies that the response has a status code of 302, indicating a redirection.
    3. Checks that the response is redirected to the specified `REDIRECT_URL`.

    Note:
        This test is designed to confirm that the RedirectMiddleware correctly redirects requests to
        the specified URL in an integration context. The actual behavior may vary based on the
        middleware's implementation and the provided `REDIRECT_URL`.

    # Should be redirected
