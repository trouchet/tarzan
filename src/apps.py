"""
This Django AppConfig class defines configuration settings for the 'src' app.

Attributes:
    default_auto_field (str): The default field type to use for automatic primary key fields
        in models of this app. In this configuration, 'django.db.models.BigAutoField' is set,
        which specifies the use of a large auto-incrementing integer as the primary key.

    name (str): The name of the app. In this configuration, the name is set to 'src',
        indicating that this AppConfig class is associated with the 'src' Django app.

Description:
    This AppConfig class allows customization of app-specific settings. In this case,
    it specifies the default primary key field type and associates it with the 'src' app.

Usage:
    This AppConfig class should be included in the 'INSTALLED_APPS' list in the Django
    project's settings (typically in the 'settings.py' file) to enable its configuration.

Example Usage (settings.py):
    ```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        'src',  # Include the 'src' app in the list of installed apps
        # ...
    ]
    ```

    By adding 'src' to the 'INSTALLED_APPS', you enable the configuration defined in this
    AppConfig class for the 'src' app.
