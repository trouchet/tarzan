In Django, you can leverage the powerful template engine to create dynamic and data-driven web pages. Here's how you can perform these actions in the Django frontend using the template engine, template tags, and filters:

**Leverage Django's Template Engine** 

Django's template engine is a powerful tool for creating dynamic web pages. It allows you to mix HTML with template tags and filters to display dynamic content from your backend in your frontend views.

- Create Templates:

Start by creating HTML templates for your web pages. Templates are typically stored in a directory named templates within your app's directory structure.

For example, if you have an app named "blog," you can create a template for a blog post detail page as follows:

```html

<!-- templates/blog/post_detail.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>{{ post.title }}</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>{{ post.title }}</h1>
    <p>{{ post.content }}</p>
</body>
</html>
```

- Use Template Tags:

Django provides a wide range of template tags that you can use to embed Python logic in your templates. For example, you can use {% if %}, {% for %}, and {% block %} tags to control the flow and structure of your HTML.

Here's an example of using an {% if %} tag to conditionally display content:

```html
{% if user.is_authenticated %}
    <p>Welcome, {{ user.username }}!</p>
{% else %}
    <p>Please log in to access this content.</p>
{% endif %}
```

**Use Template Filters**

Django template filters allow you to modify the content displayed in your templates. You can use filters to format dates, numbers, and text, among other things.

For example, you can use the date filter to format a date:

```html
<p>Published on {{ post.published_date|date:"F d, Y" }}</p>
```

**Pass Data to Templates**

In your views, you'll need to pass data to your templates to make them dynamic. This is typically done using the render function in Django views. For example:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Post

def post_detail(request, post_id):
    post = Post.objects.get(pk=post_id)
    return render(request, 'blog/post_detail.html', {'post': post})
```

In this example, the post object is passed to the post_detail.html template.

**Include Templates in Other Templates**

Django allows you to include templates within other templates using the {% include %} template tag. This is useful for reusing common components across different pages.

For example, if you have a header and footer that you want to include on every page, you can create separate templates for them and include them in your main layout template.

```html
{% include 'common/header.html' %}

<!-- Main content goes here -->

{% include 'common/footer.html' %}
```

By following these steps, you can effectively leverage Django's template engine, template tags, and filters to create dynamic and data-driven web pages in your Django application.
