Using Django Signals allows you to harness the power of event-driven programming within your Django application. Signals are used to allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers that some action has taken place, enabling decoupled and extensible applications. Here's how you can perform actions related to Django Signals in a Django context:

**Import Signals**

First, you'll need to import the necessary signals and create signal handlers. In Django, signals are part of the django.dispatch module.

```python
from django.dispatch import Signal, receiver
```

**Create Signals**

You can create your custom signals in your Django app's signals.py file. For example, let's say you want to create a signal to notify when a new user is registered:

```python
# signals.py
user_registered = Signal()
```

**Create Signal Handlers**

Next, you'll create signal handlers to respond to these signals. Signal handlers are Python functions decorated with @receiver. They execute when the signal they are connected to is sent.

```python
# signals.py
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def user_registered_handler(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        # Perform actions when a new user is registered
        user = instance
        print(f"User {user.username} has been registered!")
```

In this example, the user_registered_handler function listens to the post_save signal of the User model and executes when a new user is created.

**Connect Signal Handlers**

You need to connect your signal handlers to the signals. This is typically done in the apps.py file of your Django app or in your app's ready method.

```python
# apps.py
from django.apps import AppConfig

class YourAppConfig(AppConfig):
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
    name = 'yourapp'

    def ready(self):
        import yourapp.signals  # Import your signals module
```

Ensure that you replace 'yourapp' with the actual name of your app.

**Sending Signals**

In your application code, when an event occurs that should trigger the signal, you can send the signal using the send method:

```python
    from yourapp.signals import user_registered

    # Inside your view, for example
    user_registered.send(sender=self.__class__, instance=user)
```

**Receiver Functions**

When the signal is sent, the receiver functions (signal handlers) connected to it will be executed automatically.

**Documentation**

For more information on Django Signals and their usage, you can refer to the official Django documentation on signals: Django Signals Documentation

By following these steps, you can use Django Signals to implement event-driven programming within your Django application, allowing for greater flexibility and extensibility.
