User Registration and Login Functionality:

    a. Create a Django Project and App: Start by creating a Django project and app if you haven't already.
    b. Set Up Authentication Views and URLs: In your app's urls.py file, configure URLs for user registration, login, and logout using Django's built-in views and forms.
    c. Create User Model: You can use Django's built-in User model, or if you need custom fields, create a custom user model by extending AbstractBaseUser and PermissionsMixin.
    d. Create Registration View and Template: Implement a view that handles user registration using Django forms. Create an associated HTML template for the registration form.
    e. Create Login View and Template: Similarly, create a view and template for user login.
    f. Implement Logout: Create a view to handle user logout.

User Profile Management Features:

    a. Create Profile Model: Create a model to store user profile information, such as a user's bio, profile picture, etc.
    b. Link Profile to User: Link the user profile model to the user model using a one-to-one relationship.
    c. Create Profile Edit View: Implement a view to allow users to edit their profile information.
    d. Secure Profile Access: Ensure that only the user who owns the profile can edit it. You can use decorators like @login_required to restrict access.

Password Reset and Change Functionality:

    a. Password Reset: Django provides built-in views for password reset. Configure the URLs and templates for password reset and password reset confirmation.
    b. Password Change: Implement a view for users to change their passwords. Use Django's PasswordChangeView.

Integrate with Social Authentication (OAuth):

    a. Choose an OAuth Provider: Decide which OAuth provider(s) you want to integrate with (e.g., Google, Facebook, GitHub).
    b. Install Django Allauth (optional): You can use third-party packages like django-allauth to simplify social authentication. Install it using pip.
    c. Configure OAuth Settings: Configure your OAuth provider(s) (e.g., get API keys and secrets) and add them to your Django settings.
    d. Implement Social Login Views: Create views that handle the OAuth authentication process, including redirecting users to the OAuth provider's login page and handling callback URLs.
    e. Create Social App Entries (Django Allauth): If you're using django-allauth, you'll need to create social app entries in the Django admin panel for each OAuth provider.
    f. Link Social Accounts to User Profiles: When a user logs in via OAuth, link their social account to their user profile.
    g. Customize Templates (Django Allauth): Customize the templates provided by django-allauth to match your application's design.
